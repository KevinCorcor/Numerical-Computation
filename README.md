# Numerical-Computation 

This repository houses successfully complete Python code which implements several numerical algorithms as functions.
These include the following:
* some generic matrix manipulation functions
* Newton Raphson - solving non-linear equations
* Divided Differences
* second derivative test
* Gauss Siedel - with and without relaxation
* Gaussian Elimination using
  * Tridiagonal LU decomposition
  * LU decomposition
  * Partial Pivoting
  * Jacobian
  
  
  NOTE: be aware as to the mechanism of row swapping when pivoting. Different approaches are taken at different sources
